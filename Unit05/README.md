# Unit 05 - Writing Classes

## 5.1 - Anatomy of a Class
Private: can only be accessed in their own class

Public: can be accessed outside their own class

---

Classes - `public` - always

Instance Vars - `private` - always (encapsulation)

Constructors - `public` - always

Methods - `public` or `private`

## 5.2 - Constructors
Each class "has-a" private instance variable

Default constructor has no input and has default values

Need to set all instance vars to something in constructors even if not used

// single line comment

/* multi-line comment */

/** Documentation * Comment * to create Javadoc */

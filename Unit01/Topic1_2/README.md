# 1.2 Variables and Data Types
Primitive data determines the size and type of information
boolean - true or false - 1 bit
int - whole numbers - 32 bit
double - decimal values/floating-point numbers - 64 bit
string - text - non-primitive

Primitive Types are part of Java Language
Except for String, non-primitve types are generally created by programmer
Non-primitive types can use methods to perform actions, but primitives types can't

Variable - name give to a memory location that is holding a specified type value

# Naming A Variable:
may consist of letters, digits, or an underscore (case sensitive)
may not start witha digit
spaces are not allowed
may not use any other characters such as & or @ or $
may not use Java reserved words
good practice is "camel case"

# Declaring Variables
dataType variableName;
ex:
int total;
double intRate;
boolean isWindy;

# Constants
use Java reserved word final in front of declaration
use all caps and underscores in naming them
final double PI;
final int DAY_IN_WEEK;
final boolean JAVA_ROCKS;

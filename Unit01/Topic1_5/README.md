# 1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables
## Casting
Casting used in Java to change date type of one variable to another

`System.out.println((double)6/4);`

When a double is turned to an int it is rounded down

Add .5 for normal rounding

## Overflow
Data types are limited in information they can store

integer limit - `int maxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE;` to `int minInt = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`

Overflow - happens when int goes outside range of Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE

Causes number to roll over

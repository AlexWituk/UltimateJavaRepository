# Unit 4 - Iteration

## 4.1 - `while` Loops

>while (boolean expression) {
    code here;
}

Make sure loops don't go infinetly dummy - update variable in loop

## 4.2 - `for` Loops

>for (initialization; boolean condition; update) {
    code here;
}

for loops can be the same as while loops 

## 4.3 - Developing Algorithms Using Strings

Make sure to stay in bounds of string length when searching inside string


## 4.4 - Nested Iteration

Nested loops work like a clock

## 4.5 - Informal Code Analysis

>for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    code here will run num times
}

# 2.9 Using the Math Class
## Math Class Overview
Math class methods are pre-defined, return numeric values, and act upon the given parameter

Pre-defined in java refers to an organized collection of classes called class libraries

Math class methods are static

Static is a Java keyword referring to how objects are handled in memory

Static methods are those that belong to a class instead of objects of a class

Math class methods do not require instance variable creation

On JQR

## Math.random()
gives double between 0.0 and 1.0

`System.out.println((int)(Math.random() * 10 + 1));`

Prints number from 1 to 10

10 = range || 1 = starting point

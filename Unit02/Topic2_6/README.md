# 2.6 String Objects - Concatenation, Literals, and More
## Instantianting Strings
`String name1 = "alex";`

`String name2 = new String("alex2");`

`String name3 = new String(name1);`

## Strings
Strings are immutable meaning unable to change

Methods that act on them do not change their original state

## Concatenation
is the joining of data

Operators used to concatenate are + and +=

`String name4 = name1 + name2`

`String name1 += name2`

## Escape Sequences
allow the output of special characters and insertion of actions

The \ backslash is used to start escape sequences

\" - prints a double quote character

\\\ - prints a backslash character

\n - inserts a new line
